## 12. Constraints & Assumptions

### 12.1 Technical Constraints

#### CON-TC-001: In-Memory State
**Constraint**: All game state stored in server memory  
**Impact**: State lost on server restart  
**Mitigation**: Manual export/import commands for demos  
**Future**: Database persistence layer

#### CON-TC-002: Single Server Instance
**Constraint**: No horizontal scaling support  
**Impact**: Limited to one server process  
**Mitigation**: Vertical scaling, process management  
**Future**: Distributed architecture with Redis

#### CON-TC-003: WebSocket Only
**Constraint**: Real-time communication requires WebSocket  
**Impact**: No HTTP polling fallback  
**Mitigation**: Clear error messages for WebSocket failures  
**Future**: Server-Sent Events fallback

### 12.2 Business Constraints

#### CON-BC-001: Demo/Prototype Focus
**Constraint**: Primary goal is demonstration, not production  
**Impact**: Limited features, no monetization  
**Scope**: Educational and portfolio purposes

#### CON-BC-002: API Cost Management
**Constraint**: External API usage may incur costs  
**Impact**: LIVE mode usage should be monitored  
**Mitigation**: MOCK mode as default, rate limiting

#### CON-BC-003: Open Source
**Constraint**: Code publicly available (MIT license)  
**Impact**: No proprietary features or secrets in code  
**Security**: API keys via environment variables only

### 12.3 Design Assumptions

#### ASM-DS-001: Cooperative Players
**Assumption**: Players generally cooperative, not adversarial  
**Justification**: Target audience is demo viewers and testers  
**Risk**: Griefing possible, moderation tools minimal

#### ASM-DS-002: Small Player Count
**Assumption**: Typical session has 5-20 concurrent players  
**Justification**: Demo/prototype scale  
**Risk**: Performance issues if exceeded

#### ASM-DS-003: Short Sessions
**Assumption**: Most play sessions <1 hour  
**Justification**: Casual gameplay style  
**Risk**: In-memory state loss acceptable for demos

#### ASM-DS-004: Modern Browsers
**Assumption**: Players use modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)  
**Justification**: WebSocket and ES6+ required  
**Risk**: No IE11 or legacy browser support

## 13. Risk Assessment

### 13.1 Technical Risks

#### RISK-T-001: API Availability
**Risk**: Janitor AI or Letta API unavailable  
**Probability**: MEDIUM  
**Impact**: HIGH  
**Mitigation**: MOCK mode fallback, health monitoring  
**Contingency**: Game fully playable in MOCK mode

#### RISK-T-002: State Loss
**Risk**: Server crash loses all game state  
**Probability**: LOW-MEDIUM  
**Impact**: MEDIUM  
**Mitigation**: Regular state export reminders  
**Contingency**: Players understand demo nature

#### RISK-T-003: WebSocket Instability
**Risk**: Network issues cause frequent disconnects  
**Probability**: MEDIUM  
**Impact**: MEDIUM  
**Mitigation**: Auto-reconnect logic, connection status UI  
**Contingency**: Manual reconnect instructions

#### RISK-T-004: Concurrent Modification Bugs
**Risk**: Race conditions on trades or votes  
**Probability**: LOW  
**Impact**: HIGH  
**Mitigation**: Atomic operations, validation checks, unit tests  
**Contingency**: Manual state correction by admin

### 13.2 User Experience Risks

#### RISK-UX-001: Elder Response Quality
**Risk**: AI responses inappropriate or nonsensical  
**Probability**: LOW-MEDIUM (LIVE mode)  
**Impact**: MEDIUM  
**Mitigation**: System prompts, fallback to MOCK, content filtering  
**Contingency**: Admin can manually inject messages

#### RISK-UX-002: Learning Curve
**Risk**: New players confused by commands  
**Probability**: MEDIUM  
**Impact**: MEDIUM  
**Mitigation**: Help command, Elder tutorials, clear error messages  
**Contingency**: Tutorial mode or onboarding flow

#### RISK-UX-003: Player Isolation
**Risk**: Players feel ignored if Elder doesn't respond  
**Probability**: MEDIUM  
**Impact**: LOW  
**Mitigation**: Cadence system ensures regular Elder pulses  
**Contingency**: Adjust cadence thresholds

### 13.3 Project Risks

#### RISK-P-001: Scope Creep
**Risk**: Feature requests exceed MVP scope  
**Probability**: HIGH  
**Impact**: HIGH  
**Mitigation**: Clear MVP definition, prioritization framework  
**Contingency**: Defer features to v2.0

#### RISK-P-002: API Cost Overrun
**Risk**: LIVE mode usage exceeds budget  
**Probability**: LOW  
**Impact**: MEDIUM  
**Mitigation**: Rate limiting, MOCK mode default, usage monitoring  
**Contingency**: Disable LIVE mode temporarily
